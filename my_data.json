Please say hi or hola if you see me around!\nKeerti Bajaj\nFinancial Coordinator\nFall 2024 Live Chat: Wednesdays 10-2 PM\nIndia\niPhD Computer Science\nHola… aloha… everyone! My name is Keerti Bajaj. I am from Hyderabad, India (the place where the famous \"DUM BIRYANI\" comes from). I moved around many places in and out of India to study, explore, experience and spread wings across. I came here to Kansas City, to UMKC, in Fall 2021. I really fell in love with the place, it has great places, people and vibe!\nI like exploring new places, food and meeting strangers to making friends. I absolutely love cooking, it’s Zen. If I weren’t doing what I am now, I would be a chef. I love fantasies and theories, and I made so many of them personally! I’m always curious to try everything that’s new to me, learn it and just gain new skills.\nI prefer sunrises over sunsets (both are equally beautiful, just what they mean individually to me). I love star gazing, any place with pretty lights (such as downtown), long drives and long walks are some of the things I do to get out of my tiring schedule. If you are reading this, I \"REALLY\" look forward to meeting you sometime on campus!!\nVictor Olantunji\nProgramming Coordinator\nFall 2024 Live Chat: Mondays 2-5 PM, Tuesdays 4-5 PM\nNigeria\nBS Computer Science\nHello everyone! My name is Victor Olatunji, and I'm excited to serve as an International Student Ambassador at the University of Missouri-Kansas City (UMKC) this year. As a Computer Science student, I have a passion for coding, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, and all things tech related.\nWhile I am Nigerian by nationality courtesy of my parents, my life has been a global adventure. Born in Malawi, I spent my early years in Mozambique before moving to Kenya for schooling. This diverse upbringing has allowed me to immerse myself in different cultures, an experience I'm incredibly grateful for. \nAt UMKC, I've actively engaged in various clubs and organizations, fostering lifelong friendships and personal growth beyond academics. When I'm not studying, I enjoy playing, watching, or gaming related to football (soccer), table tennis, reading, exploring new cuisines, traveling, and spending quality time with friends. \nOne of the highlights of my UMKC experience has been connecting with people from diverse backgrounds while also building a sense of community with fellow international students. Participating in campus events has been a fantastic way to do this. \nAs an International Student Ambassador, I'm eager to share my experiences, inspire others, and provide support to fellow students. I believe UMKC offers fertile ground for everyone to reach their full potential, and I'm excited to be part of that journey with you. \nI look forward to welcoming you to the UMKC community and building connections. Please don't hesitate to reach out with any questions or just to chat. I can't wait to see what we can accomplish together!\nHanan Jan\nProgramming Coordinator\nFall 2023 Live Chat: Mondays 2-5 PM, Tuesdays 4-5 PM\nSaudi Arabia and Pakistan\nBSC Mathematics and Statistics\nHey! I'm Hanan, from Gilgit Baltistan, in the northern areas of Pakistan. I was born and raised in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.\nI love playing games in my free time and have been part of the KC Esports team for Overwatch since the Fall of 2023. Another fun fact about me is that I'm interested in learning more languages!\nI tend to spend most of my days on campus, so don't be scared to come up and say hi!\nPrajwal Rasaily\nCulture Fest Coordinator\nFall 2024 Live Chat: Wednesdays 1:30-4 PM, Fridays 8-9:30 AM\nNepal\nMS Accounting, Business Analytics\nNamaste, Roos and everyone! I am Prajwal Rasaily from the beautiful land of the Himalayas, Nepal. I am pursuing a Master of Science in Accounting degree with a Graduate Certificate in Business Analytics at the Henry Bloch School of Management. \nComing to UMKC has been one of the best decisions of my life. Although I left the comfort of my home in Nepal, UMKC provided me with the support, love, and care that made me feel at home. The community here is incredibly welcoming and always ready to support—you just have to reach out! \nAs an international student who has navigated the challenges of adjusting to a new country, I understand what you might be going through. Please feel free to connect with me if you need any assistance or just someone to talk to. You can often find me in Bloch Heritage Hall, where I work as a Graduate Assistant, or around Miller Nichols Library. \nUMKC is not just a place where you gain academic knowledge; you gain a nurturing environment that helps you grow personally and professionally. Don’t just take my word for it—come and experience the supportive and transformative atmosphere of UMKC for yourself.  \nA fun fact about me: I love to cook, no matter how tight my schedule is. I always find a way to modify recipes and make dishes presentable and delicious. I look forward to meeting you and sharing the wonderful experiences UMKC has to offer! GO ROOS!\nShahla Daneshmehr\nCulture Fest Coordinator\nFall 2024 Live Chat: Fridays 10:30-1 PM, 2-3:30 PM\nIran\niPhD Natural Sciences\nI’m a Turkish-Iranian international student ambassador working on an Interdisciplinary doctorate in Natural Sciences, focusing on the connections between, chemistry, physics, and biology. Being multilingual and having a rich cultural background helps me connect easily with people from different cultures.\nIn addition to my academic interests, I enjoy cooking and am known for making Kufte-Tabrizi (Tabriz meatballs), a famous dish from my homeland. Imagine a meatball with a boiled egg, dried apricot, and walnut inside—it’s amazing and super delicious!\nAs an international student ambassador, I’m excited to help others feel welcome and supported. I believe that a diverse community makes our campus special, and I’m here to make sure everyone feels included and at home. Whether it’s through conversation, cultural exchange, or just being a friendly face, I’m dedicated to making a positive impact on our community.\nI truly look forward to meeting you sometime on campus!\nRaza Hussain Khoso\nMarketing Coordinator\nFall 2024 Live Chat: Mondays 9-1 PM\nPakistan\nMBA Business Analytics\nDhaz Dhaz Dhaz! Asalam u Alikum Everyone. Sab Se Phele Toh Apne Ghabrana Nahi Hai! My name is Raza Hussain Khoso. I am from Karachi, Pakistan. Karachi is called the “City of Lights” and the city which never sleeps. I completed my undergraduate degree from Pakistan and ended up getting a Silver Medal & Gold Medal for being the high achiever. Now I have been here at UMKC since 2023, and I really love it. I am pursuing my master’s with the goal of exploring new cultures and being able to experience exciting journey. I am an extrovert and social individual. 🤪\nI like traveling, food and making new friends. I love cooking. I am a chef now. That was my first time out of my home country (I haven’t traveled much but would love to do it in future.). My time at UMKC has been filled with some amazing memories. One of the things I absolutely love about UMKC is its rich diversity and inclusive community. A little fun fact about me: I love networking, making connections and helping others no matter what the situation is.\nOutside of academics, I'm involved in different organizations that help me improve my interpersonal skills. I am a President at UMKC Data Analytics and AIESEC in UMKC. I love being outdoors and exploring new surroundings, but I also love staying in and watching Netflix, a mix of being with friends, music, board games and trying new foods.\nYou can see me everywhere on campus like the ASSC, Library, Bloch School, Student Union and especially in the Swinney because I like sports, play badminton and gym enthusiast so if you want to play Badminton, find me there. If you see me anywhere on campus and need help, say Hi! What I want you to know is that I am here for you. If you want to talk about anything, whether you have a million zillion questions about UMKC, or just to have a chill conversation.\nAs an International Student Ambassador, my goal is to share my UMKC journey, inspire others, and provide support and guidance to fellow students. I believe that every student at UMKC has the potential to thrive and make the most of their time here, just as I have cherished my past year at this exceptional institution.\nLet’s begin the show Roos! 🐾\nRaza!\nSumeya Geelle\nSocial Media Coordinator\nFall 2023 Live Chat:Mondays 10-12 PM, Fridays 10:30-12:30 PM\nSomali-American\nBusiness Administration with an emphasis in Marketing\nHey guys!\nMy name is Sumeya Geelle and I'm excited to be on the journey ahead of being your international student ambassador J I was born and raised in Kansas City but however moved to Kenya in 2019, but I’m ethnically Somali. I attended a British International University there for about 3 years and then returned to the States. Yes, I know you’re wondering, I did in fact pick up on the British accent which I really wish I stuck to L  I came to UMKC on an International Business Administration route for my undergrad (which UMKC doesn’t provide) however I later switched to marketing.\nSomething I really enjoy is skincare, shopping & watching new dramas. I’m also a rising football (soccer) fan. I've been traveling a lot lately, which helps with my major. I am experiencing an uncanny feeling of being Emily in Paris. Everyone's interests are catered to by the wide range of activities and events in Kansas City, which is awesome and fun to discover, in my opinion. I also love meeting new people from different backgrounds. In summary, my position as an international student ambassador is to help close the cultural gap that exists between all of you and the potential cultural shock that some of you might encounter.  Creating a welcoming environment is my top priority & please don’t hesitate to reach out to me on any and everything whether it be a coffee date or questions about how to get over obstacles! 💌\nNonetheless, I’m excited to meet everyone and get to know you all.\nHave a great semester & Roo Up!! 🦘\nApply\nVisit\nGet Info\nInternational Student Affairs Office\n+1 816-235-1113\nVolker Campus\n5000 Holmes St.\nKansas City, MO 64110-2499\nisao@umkc.edu\nAdmissions\nStudent Advising\nStudent Visa\nStudent Support\nInternational Affairs\nStudy Abroad and Global Exchange\nResidential Life\nKansas City\nLocation and Maps\nCampus Calendar\nA-Z Index\nJobs\nDirectory\nDiversity and Inclusion\nLibraries\nHelp Central\nConsumer Information\nAccreditation\nWebmail\nPathway\nCanvas\nUMKC Connect\nMyRoo\n© 2024 Curators of the University of Missouri | Disability Resources | Privacy Policy | DMCA Policy | Issues with this website? | Editor Access\nUMKC is an equal opportunity/access/affirmative action/pro-disability and veteran employer and does not discriminate on the basis of sex in our education programs or activities, pursuant to Title IX and 34 CFR Part 106.

Transfer work will not be posted to your UMKC academic record until official transcripts are received. Transfer work is only posted for students working toward their first bachelor’s degree.\nLearn more about transfer credit\nUndergraduate students who have graduated from high schools in countries where the language of instruction is not English may also receive foreign language credit for their native languages.\nEvaluating transcripts for transfer credit\nAll undergraduate college coursework attempted at recognized institutions will be recorded on the UMKC transcript of students seeking an undergraduate degree, regardless of whether it is applicable to a UMKC degree. Credit accepted from another institution may or may not be applicable to specific degree programs. The university reserves the right to make the decision regarding applicability.\nRemedial courses will not be added to the total hours or used to satisfy degree requirements. The Registrar’s Office will refer to the transcript key or catalog of the sending institution in making a determination as to the level or purpose of the course in question.\nTransferred courses will be considered upper-division (junior-senior level) and count toward the total number of upper-division hours required if they are earned at a four-year institution and designated by that institution’s course numbering system as upper-division courses.\nA course transferred from an accredited U.S. institution will retain the original number of credit hours for which it was taken at the previous institution, even if the equivalent UMKC course is worth a different number of hours.\nA course transferred from a recognized international institution will be converted by ISAO staff into U.S.-based Carnegie Units.\nIn general, courses with a grade of D or higher will receive full credit in transfer.\nFor some degree programs, a course with a grade of D may not be used to satisfy specific requirements. A transfer student would be required to repeat a specified course on the same basis as a domestic UMKC student who earned a D in the equivalent course.\nCoursework of any age will be accepted in transfer to satisfy general education requirements and electives. If transfer credit is more than 15 years old, or of a specific technical or scientific nature, students may be required to repeat courses that are part of a major or field concentration. Individual UMKC academic units may impose more restrictive coursework age requirements.\nApply\nVisit\nGet Info\nInternational Student Affairs Office\n+1 816-235-1113\nVolker Campus\n5000 Holmes St.\nKansas City, MO 64110-2499\nisao@umkc.edu\nAdmissions\nStudent Advising\nStudent Visa\nStudent Support\nInternational Affairs\nStudy Abroad and Global Exchange\nResidential Life\nKansas City\nLocation and Maps\nCampus Calendar\nA-Z Index\nJobs\nDirectory\nDiversity and Inclusion\nLibraries\nHelp Central\nConsumer Information\nAccreditation\nWebmail\nPathway\nCanvas\nUMKC Connect\nMyRoo\n© 2024 Curators of the University of Missouri | Disability Resources | Privacy Policy | DMCA Policy | Issues with this website? | Editor Access\nUMKC is an equal opportunity/access/affirmative action/pro-disability and veteran employer and does not discriminate on the basis of sex in our education programs or activities, pursuant to Title IX and 34 CFR Part 106.

You may choose to enroll in more courses; however, that means higher total tuition costs.\nDo not expect or depend on financial aid or part-time employment to meet your educational expenses. On-campus employment is competitive and is not guaranteed.\nPayment of Fees\nAll fees are due and payable to the university at the date determined by the fee schedules. A minimum payment option is available for students unable to complete payment in full by the first due date of the semester. You may arrange a payment plan with the Cashier's Office.\nThe University does not require payment in full at enrollment. However, students are required to make monthly payments toward their outstanding balance over the course of the semester. You can view the payment schedule here.\nIf your bill for tuition and mandatory fees should be sent to a government sponsoring agency or institution, please submit your sponsor's financial guarantee letter to the Cashier's Office and to ISAO by the first payment deadline.\nQuestions about fees or your bill? Contact the Cashier’s Office.\nFinancial Aid and Awards\nUniversity-funded financial aid is limited, and the aid that does exist through the UMKC Financial Aid and Scholarship Office may only be eligible for US citizens and permanent residence through US Federal financial support. However, some of the UMKC competitive scholarships may be available for international students. Explore opportunities through the Financial Aid and Scholarship Office.\nThe most substantial financial support at UMKC is available as an academic scholarship awarded at the time of admission or for graduate students in the form of graduate assistantships, for which international students are not considered until after a semester or a year of study at UMKC.\nInternational students awarded graduate assistantships that include teaching responsibilities must satisfactorily complete an English language screening and training program before undertaking teaching assignments.

    "content": "UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-KANSAS CITY\nsearch\n\nInternational Student Affairs Office\nKuwait\nHome / Sponsored Students / Kuwait\nWe make it a priority to assist our Kuwaiti-sponsored students and to make the transition to life at UMKC and in the United States as easy as possible.\nSPONSORED STUDENTS\nKuwait\nOman\nSaudi Arabia\nSponsor Information\nWelcome to UMKC!\nCongratulations on receiving a scholarship from the Embassy of Kuwait! Because you are sponsored by the Embassy of Kuwait, there are specific instructions to follow and requirements to meet.\nFinancial guarantees\nA financial guarantee from the Embassy of Kuwait is required for us to bill the embassy for your tuition and fees. Typically, your advisor at the Embassy of Kuwait will send your financial guarantee directly to our sponsored student officer. If you are receiving bills from the Cashiers Office saying you have unpaid tuition, request a copy of your financial guarantee and email it to our sponsored student officer, Morgan Ramsey.\nCheck-in\nWhen you arrive in Kansas City, you will need to schedule a check-in session through Online Services. Bring passports, student visa, I-20s, I-94s and a local address to your check-in session.\nConsent form\nA Consent Form (PDF) is required for sponsored students because UMKC needs permission from the student to issue student information to a sponsoring agency. You will be asked to complete a consent form at your check-in session.\nInternational Student Orientation\nThe mandatory International Student Orientation is usually held on the Tuesday before classes start. Failure to attend orientation will result in a hold on your account, which prevents you from enrolling in future semesters. The only way to remove this hold is to attend another orientation.\nEnglish evaluation\nStudents who are conditionally admitted to UMKC will be required to take an English evaluation at the Applied Language Institute upon arrival. This evaluation will determine what level of ESL courses might be required.\nHealth insurance\nAll new international students are automatically enrolled in UMKC’s student health insurance program. Because Kuwaiti-sponsored students and their dependents receive insurance through the Embassy of Kuwait, you do not need to have this student insurance. To avoid being automatically charged for UMKC health insurance, please complete a Health Insurance Waiver (PDF) and turn it in during your check-in session.\nEnrollment\nWhen you have completed your check-in session and English evaluation, if needed, you can meet with an academic advisor to begin selecting courses. It is your responsibility to make sure you are enrolled full time (undergraduate: 12 credit hours, graduate: nine credit hours).\nKuwaiti-sponsored students are not permitted to enroll in online, evening, weekend, accelerated PACE or Arabic language courses without special permission from the Embassy of Kuwait. If an academic advisor discusses online courses during the course selection process, it is your responsibility to explain to the academic advisor that you are unable to enroll in online courses due to scholarship restrictions.\nLate enrollment fees are not covered by the Embassy of Kuwait.\nPlease review the Kuwait MOHE Rules and Regulations for more information.\nChange of major\nIf you wish to change your major you must first get approval from your advisor at the Embassy of Kuwait. If your advisor at the Embassy of Kuwait approves the change of major, you will receive a new financial guarantee which you must submit to us.\nStudent housing\nThere are a variety of living arrangements available to students. If you would like to learn more about on-campus housing, please review the information provided by Residential Life.\nON THIS PAGE\nWelcome to UMKC!\nFinancial guarantees\nCheck-in\nConsent form\nInternational Student Orientation\nEnglish evaluation\nHealth insurance\nEnrollment\nChange of major\nStudent housing\nApply\nVisit\nGet Info\nInternational Student Affairs Office\n+1 816-235-1113\nVolker Campus\n5000 Holmes St.\nKansas City, MO 64110-2499\nisao@umkc.edu\nAdmissions\nStudent Advising\nStudent Visa\nStudent Support\nInternational Affairs\nStudy Abroad and Global Exchange\nResidential Life\nKansas City\nLocation and Maps\nCampus Calendar\nA-Z Index\nJobs\nDirectory\nDiversity and Inclusion\nLibraries\nHelp Central\nConsumer Information\nAccreditation\nWebmail\nPathway\nCanvas\nUMKC Connect\nMyRoo\n© 2023 Curators of the University of Missouri | Disability Resources | Privacy Policy | DMCA Policy | Issues with this website? | Editor Access\nUMKC is an equal opportunity/access/affirmative action/pro-disability and veteran employer and does not discriminate on the basis of sex in our education programs or activities, pursuant to Title IX and 34 CFR Part 106.

    "content": "UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-KANSAS CITY\nsearch\n\nInternational Student Affairs Office\nSaudi Arabia\nHome / Sponsored Students / Saudi Arabia\nWe make it a priority to assist our Saudi Arabian Cultural Mission (SACM)-sponsored students and to make the transition to life at UMKC and in the United States as easy as possible.\nSPONSORED STUDENTS\nKuwait\nOman\nSaudi Arabia\nSponsor Information\nWelcome to UMKC!\nWe are excited that you have chosen to attend UMKC and look forward to meeting you on campus. \nWe understand the importance of a scholarship from SACM, and we're here to answer your questions about sponsorship and enrollment.\nFinancial guarantees\nA financial guarantee from SACM is required in order to receive full admission and an I-20 form from UMKC. These are provided to students by SACM only after meeting these conditions.\nThe student has submitted proof of eligibility for a SACM sponsorship (generally through a For Admissions Purposes Only letter)\nUMKC provides the student with a pre-admit letter to be given to SACM in return for the financial guarantee\nCheck-in session\nWhen you arrive in Kansas City, you will need to schedule a check-in session through Online Services. Bring passports, scholarship award letters, I-20s, I-94s and a local address to your check-in session.\nConsent Form\nThe Consent Form is a release of certain FERPA rights to UMKC, allowing the sharing of information between SACM and UMKC. Admitted students will be expected to complete a consent form at check-in.\nInternational Student Orientation\nThe mandatory International Student Orientation is always held on the Tuesday before classes start. Failure to attend orientation will result in a hold on your account, which prevents you from enrolling in future semesters. The only way to remove this hold is to attend another orientation.\nEnglish evaluation\nStudents placed at UMKC for academic coursework who have TOEFL scores of less than 100 iBT or IELTS scores of less than 6.5 will be required to take an English evaluation at the Applied Language Institute upon arrival.\nESL courses\nThose who are coming for short-term English studies will be taking ESL courses at our Applied Language Institute. Failure to complete the ESL coursework in the allotted time will prevent you from being released into academic coursework.\nSACM will pay for up to two academic years of English classes. Further enrollment in ALI must be paid by the student.\nEnrollment\nWhen students have completed the check-in session and their English evaluation, if needed, they can meet with an academic advisor to begin selecting and enrolling in courses. It is the student’s responsibility to make sure they are enrolled full time (undergraduate: 12 credit hours, graduate: nine credit hours).\nYou are not permitted to enroll in online, evening or Arabic language courses without special permission from SACM. If an academic advisor discusses online courses during the course selection process, it is your responsibility to explain to the academic advisor that you are unable to enroll in online courses due to scholarship restrictions.\nLate enrollment fees are not covered by SACM.\nChange of major\nSACM has approved students for scholarships based on the major for which they have applied. If you wish to change your major, you must first get approval from your SACM advisor. If your SACM advisor approves the change of major, you will receive a new financial guarantee which you should submit to ISAO.\nHealth insurance\nAll new international students are automatically enrolled in UMKC’s health insurance program. SACM-sponsored students and their dependents receive insurance through SACM. To avoid automatic charges for UMKC health insurance, complete a Health Insurance Waiver (PDF) and turn it in during your check-in session.\nStudent housing\nA student cannot submit a housing contract without an SSO or UMKC ID.\nON THIS PAGE\nWelcome to UMKC!\nFinancial guarantees\nCheck-in session\nConsent Form\nInternational Student Orientation\nEnglish evaluation\nESL courses\nEnrollment\nChange of major\nHealth insurance\nStudent housing\nApply\nVisit\nGet Info\nInternational Student Affairs Office\n+1 816-235-1113\nVolker Campus\n5000 Holmes St.\nKansas City, MO 64110-2499\nisao@umkc.edu\nAdmissions\nStudent Advising\nStudent Visa\nStudent Support\nInternational Affairs\nStudy Abroad and Global Exchange\nResidential Life\nKansas City\nLocation and Maps\nCampus Calendar\nA-Z Index\nJobs\nDirectory\nDiversity and Inclusion\nLibraries\nHelp Central\nConsumer Information\nAccreditation\nWebmail\nPathway\nCanvas\nUMKC Connect\nMyRoo\n© 2023 Curators of the University of Missouri | Disability Resources | Privacy Policy | DMCA Policy | Issues with this website? | Editor Access\nUMKC is an equal opportunity/access/affirmative action/pro-disability and veteran employer and does not discriminate on the basis of sex in our education programs or activities, pursuant to Title IX and 34 CFR Part 106.

An F-1 student may be authorized by the DSO to participate in a curricular practical training program that is an integral part of an established curriculum. Curricular practical training is defined to be alternative work-study, internship, cooperative education or any other type of required internship or practicum that is offered by sponsoring employers through cooperative agreements with the school. Students who have received one year or more of full time curricular practical training are ineligible for post-completion academic training. Exceptions to the one academic year requirement are provided for students enrolled in graduate studies that require immediate participation in curricular practical training. A request for authorization for curricular practical training must be made to the DSO. A student may begin curricular practical training only after receiving his or her Form I-20 with the DSO endorsement.”\nLearn more about CPT\n  Full-time CPT\n Working a total of more than 20 hours per week qualifies you as full time\nYour total hours between on- and off-campus employment must be more than 20 hours per week and less than 40 (if you work 15 hours on-campus, you will only be allowed to work 25 hours off-campus.\nA total of 365 days of full-time on CPT makes you ineligible for OPT (if you work three months of full-time CPT each summer break for four years your total is 365 days)\nYou must maintain full-time enrollment or have submitted an FTE form\nBachelor-level students - Full-time CPT is allowed only during summer break, winter break or in your graduating semester\nMaster-level students - Full-time CPT is allowed only during summer break, winter break or in your graduating semester\nPh.D.-level students - Full-time CPT is reviewed and authorized on a case-by-case basis\nPart-time CPT\nWorking a total of 20 hours or less per week is considered part-time\nYou can apply for CPT even if you have an on-campus job, including research and teaching assistantships\nBeginning in fall 2021, you can work up to 20 hours per week on campus while also working up to 20 hours per week off campus in part-time CPT\nVolunteer and unpaid work\nEmployment is defined by the experience; not by whether or not you are paid. If your internship is unpaid, you may still need CPT authorization before starting work. \nAlways consult your ISAO advisor before starting any type of work, including volunteer or unpaid internships.

CPT is academic in nature. We do not recommend that you bridge CPT employment to OPT as this may result in issues with your Post-Completion OPT application, STEM OPT or H1B. If your CPT internship unexpectedly becomes an offer for full-time OPT, we recommend getting a new offer letter stating how your position has changed.\nYou may not begin work until you receive a new I-20 with employment authorization for your specific employer and dates of employment.\nStarting work before you are authorized is considered unauthorized employment and will result in the termination of your I-20/F-1 status in the United States.\nApply\nVisit\nGet Info\nInternational Student Affairs Office\n+1 816-235-1113\nVolker Campus\n5000 Holmes St.\nKansas City, MO 64110-2499\nisao@umkc.edu\nAdmissions\nStudent Advising\nStudent Visa\nStudent Support\nInternational Affairs\nStudy Abroad and Global Exchange\nResidential Life\nKansas City\nLocation and Maps\nCampus Calendar\nA-Z Index\nJobs\nDirectory\nDiversity and Inclusion\nLibraries\nHelp Central\nConsumer Information\nAccreditation\nWebmail\nPathway\nCanvas\nUMKC Connect\nMyRoo\n© 2023 Curators of the University of Missouri | Disability Resources | Privacy Policy | DMCA Policy | Issues with this website? | Editor Access\nUMKC is an equal opportunity/access/affirmative action/pro-disability and veteran employer and does not discriminate on the basis of sex in our education programs or activities, pursuant to Title IX and 34 CFR Part 106.

You may choose to enroll in more courses; however, that means higher total tuition costs.\nDo not expect or depend on financial aid or part-time employment to meet your educational expenses. On-campus employment is competitive and is not guaranteed.\nPayment of Fees\nAll fees are due and payable to the university at the date determined by the fee schedules. A minimum payment option is available for students unable to complete payment in full by the first due date of the semester. You may arrange a payment plan with the Cashier's Office.\nThe University does not require payment in full at enrollment. However, students are required to make monthly payments toward their outstanding balance over the course of the semester. You can view the payment schedule here.\nIf your bill for tuition and mandatory fees should be sent to a government sponsoring agency or institution, please submit your sponsor's financial guarantee letter to the Cashier's Office and to ISAO by the first payment deadline.\nQuestions about fees or your bill? Contact the Cashier’s Office.\nFinancial Aid and Awards\nUniversity-funded financial aid is limited, and the aid that does exist through the UMKC Financial Aid and Scholarship Office may only be eligible for US citizens and permanent residence through US Federal financial support. However, some of the UMKC competitive scholarships may be available for international students. Explore opportunities through the Financial Aid and Scholarship Office.\nThe most substantial financial support at UMKC is available as an academic scholarship awarded at the time of admission or for graduate students in the form of graduate assistantships, for which international students are not considered until after a semester or a year of study at UMKC.\nInternational students awarded graduate assistantships that include teaching responsibilities must satisfactorily complete an English language screening and training program before undertaking teaching assignments. Learn more about funding opportunities through the School of Graduate Studies.\nON THIS PAGE\nFinancial Arrangements\nPayment of Fees\nFinancial Aid and Awards\nApply\nVisit\nGet Info\nInternational Student Affairs Office\n+1 816-235-1113\nVolker Campus\n5000 Holmes St.\nKansas City, MO 64110-2499\nisao@umkc.edu\nAdmissions\nStudent Advising\nStudent Visa\nStudent Support\nInternational Affairs\nStudy Abroad and Global Exchange\nResidential Life\nKansas City\nLocation and Maps\nCampus Calendar\nA-Z Index\nJobs\nDirectory\nDiversity and Inclusion\nLibraries\nHelp Central\nConsumer Information\nAccreditation\nWebmail\nPathway\nCanvas\nUMKC Connect\nMyRoo\n© 2023 Curators of the University of Missouri | Disability Resources | Privacy Policy | DMCA Policy | Issues with this website? | Editor Access\nUMKC is an equal opportunity/access/affirmative action/pro-disability and veteran employer and does not discriminate on the basis of sex in our education programs or activities, pursuant to Title IX and 34 CFR Part 106.

To make things easier for you, we have teamed up with Sprintax, an online tool specifically designed for international students and scholars.\nWe provide free Federal and 8843 filing, but if you are required to file a state tax return, you will be notified in the system and can choose to self-pay to file your state tax return.\nGet started with Sprintax\nClick here to register with Sprintax\nComplete the online questionnaire.\nYour Sprintax discount code will be sent to your UMKC email account. Enter this code in the box on the “Review your order” page.\nSprintax will prepare your tax return and check if you are due a refund.\nPrint, sign and mail your documents to the IRS.\nDocuments you will need to prepare your taxes\nPassport\nEntry and exit dates for current and all past visits to the United States\nTax forms\nW-2 – if you worked on-campus or for a U.S. employer, the W-2 reports your annual wages and amount of taxes withheld from your paycheck\n1042-S and/or 1099 – if you received a scholarship, fellowship grant or other award, you may receive this form, which typically comes from the university payroll department\nVisa/immigration status information, including I-20 (for F-visa holders) or DS-2019 (J-visa holders)\nSocial Security Number (SSN) or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN). If you do not have an ITIN, Sprintax can help you get one!\nIf you are using Sprintax for State tax return preparation only, you will need the federal tax return you already prepared\nMore information from Sprintax\nSprintax Instructions 2023 (PDF)\nSprintax Brochure 2023 (PDF)\nSprintax videos on YouTube\nSprintax blog\n  Other Preparation Services\nThere are several other private tax preparation services available, such as TurboTax and H&R Block, but they charge to file your taxes and may not be able to provide you with the correct forms as a non-resident. We do not recommend using these services unless you know you qualify to file as a resident.\n  The Internal Revue Services (IRS) is the tax collection agency for the United States\nIRS website\n  Have Questions?\nIf you have any questions at all about your taxes, from \"Am I required to file taxes?\" to \"Can someone help me with Sprintax?\", please direct your questions to the University of Missouri Nonresident Tax Office.

Because you are sponsored by the Embassy of Kuwait, there are specific instructions to follow and requirements to meet.\nFinancial guarantees\nA financial guarantee from the Embassy of Kuwait is required for us to bill the embassy for your tuition and fees. Typically, your advisor at the Embassy of Kuwait will send your financial guarantee directly to our sponsored student officer. If you are receiving bills from the Cashiers Office saying you have unpaid tuition, request a copy of your financial guarantee and email it to our sponsored student officer, Morgan Ramsey.\nCheck-in\nWhen you arrive in Kansas City, you will need to schedule a check-in session through Online Services. Bring passports, student visa, I-20s, I-94s and a local address to your check-in session.\nConsent form\nA Consent Form (PDF) is required for sponsored students because UMKC needs permission from the student to issue student information to a sponsoring agency. You will be asked to complete a consent form at your check-in session.\nInternational Student Orientation\nThe mandatory International Student Orientation is usually held on the Tuesday before classes start. Failure to attend orientation will result in a hold on your account, which prevents you from enrolling in future semesters. The only way to remove this hold is to attend another orientation.\nEnglish evaluation\nStudents who are conditionally admitted to UMKC will be required to take an English evaluation at the Applied Language Institute upon arrival. This evaluation will determine what level of ESL courses might be required.\nHealth insurance\nAll new international students are automatically enrolled in UMKC’s student health insurance program. Because Kuwaiti-sponsored students and their dependents receive insurance through the Embassy of Kuwait, you do not need to have this student insurance. To avoid being automatically charged for UMKC health insurance, please complete a Health Insurance Waiver (PDF) and turn it in during your check-in session.\nEnrollment\nWhen you have completed your check-in session and English evaluation, if needed, you can meet with an academic advisor to begin selecting courses. It is your responsibility to make sure you are enrolled full time (undergraduate: 12 credit hours, graduate: nine credit hours).\nKuwaiti-sponsored students are not permitted to enroll in online, evening, weekend, accelerated PACE or Arabic language courses without special permission from the Embassy of Kuwait. If an academic advisor discusses online courses during the course selection process, it is your responsibility to explain to the academic advisor that you are unable to enroll in online courses due to scholarship restrictions.\nLate enrollment fees are not covered by the Embassy of Kuwait.\nPlease review the Kuwait MOHE Rules and Regulations for more information.\nChange of major\nIf you wish to change your major you must first get approval from your advisor at the Embassy of Kuwait. If your advisor at the Embassy of Kuwait approves the change of major, you will receive a new financial guarantee which you must submit to us.\nStudent housing\nThere are a variety of living arrangements available to students.

    "content": "UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-KANSAS CITY\nsearch\n\nInternational Student Affairs Office\nKuwait\nHome / Sponsored Students / Kuwait\nWe make it a priority to assist our Kuwaiti-sponsored students and to make the transition to life at UMKC and in the United States as easy as possible.\nSPONSORED STUDENTS\nKuwait\nOman\nSaudi Arabia\nSponsor Information\nWelcome to UMKC!\nCongratulations on receiving a scholarship from the Embassy of Kuwait! Because you are sponsored by the Embassy of Kuwait, there are specific instructions to follow and requirements to meet.\nFinancial guarantees\nA financial guarantee from the Embassy of Kuwait is required for us to bill the embassy for your tuition and fees. Typically, your advisor at the Embassy of Kuwait will send your financial guarantee directly to our sponsored student officer. If you are receiving bills from the Cashiers Office saying you have unpaid tuition, request a copy of your financial guarantee and email it to our sponsored student officer, Morgan Ramsey.\nCheck-in\nWhen you arrive in Kansas City, you will need to schedule a check-in session through Online Services. Bring passports, student visa, I-20s, I-94s and a local address to your check-in session.\nConsent form\nA Consent Form (PDF) is required for sponsored students because UMKC needs permission from the student to issue student information to a sponsoring agency. You will be asked to complete a consent form at your check-in session.\nInternational Student Orientation\nThe mandatory International Student Orientation is usually held on the Tuesday before classes start. Failure to attend orientation will result in a hold on your account, which prevents you from enrolling in future semesters. The only way to remove this hold is to attend another orientation.\nEnglish evaluation\nStudents who are conditionally admitted to UMKC will be required to take an English evaluation at the Applied Language Institute upon arrival. This evaluation will determine what level of ESL courses might be required.\nHealth insurance\nAll new international students are automatically enrolled in UMKC’s student health insurance program. Because Kuwaiti-sponsored students and their dependents receive insurance through the Embassy of Kuwait, you do not need to have this student insurance. To avoid being automatically charged for UMKC health insurance, please complete a Health Insurance Waiver (PDF) and turn it in during your check-in session.\nEnrollment\nWhen you have completed your check-in session and English evaluation, if needed, you can meet with an academic advisor to begin selecting courses. It is your responsibility to make sure you are enrolled full time (undergraduate: 12 credit hours, graduate: nine credit hours).\nKuwaiti-sponsored students are not permitted to enroll in online, evening, weekend, accelerated PACE or Arabic language courses without special permission from the Embassy of Kuwait. If an academic advisor discusses online courses during the course selection process, it is your responsibility to explain to the academic advisor that you are unable to enroll in online courses due to scholarship restrictions.\nLate enrollment fees are not covered by the Embassy of Kuwait.\nPlease review the Kuwait MOHE Rules and Regulations for more information.\nChange of major\nIf you wish to change your major you must first get approval from your advisor at the Embassy of Kuwait. If your advisor at the Embassy of Kuwait approves the change of major, you will receive a new financial guarantee which you must submit to us.\nStudent housing\nThere are a variety of living arrangements available to students.

    "content": "UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-KANSAS CITY\nsearch\n\nInternational Student Affairs Office\nKuwait\nHome / Sponsored Students / Kuwait\nWe make it a priority to assist our Kuwaiti-sponsored students and to make the transition to life at UMKC and in the United States as easy as possible.\nSPONSORED STUDENTS\nKuwait\nOman\nSaudi Arabia\nSponsor Information\nWelcome to UMKC!\nCongratulations on receiving a scholarship from the Embassy of Kuwait! Because you are sponsored by the Embassy of Kuwait, there are specific instructions to follow and requirements to meet.\nFinancial guarantees\nA financial guarantee from the Embassy of Kuwait is required for us to bill the embassy for your tuition and fees. Typically, your advisor at the Embassy of Kuwait will send your financial guarantee directly to our sponsored student officer. If you are receiving bills from the Cashiers Office saying you have unpaid tuition, request a copy of your financial guarantee and email it to our sponsored student officer, Morgan Ramsey.\nCheck-in\nWhen you arrive in Kansas City, you will need to schedule a check-in session through Online Services. Bring passports, student visa, I-20s, I-94s and a local address to your check-in session.\nConsent form\nA Consent Form (PDF) is required for sponsored students because UMKC needs permission from the student to issue student information to a sponsoring agency. You will be asked to complete a consent form at your check-in session.\nInternational Student Orientation\nThe mandatory International Student Orientation is usually held on the Tuesday before classes start. Failure to attend orientation will result in a hold on your account, which prevents you from enrolling in future semesters. The only way to remove this hold is to attend another orientation.\nEnglish evaluation\nStudents who are conditionally admitted to UMKC will be required to take an English evaluation at the Applied Language Institute upon arrival. This evaluation will determine what level of ESL courses might be required.\nHealth insurance\nAll new international students are automatically enrolled in UMKC’s student health insurance program. Because Kuwaiti-sponsored students and their dependents receive insurance through the Embassy of Kuwait, you do not need to have this student insurance. To avoid being automatically charged for UMKC health insurance, please complete a Health Insurance Waiver (PDF) and turn it in during your check-in session.\nEnrollment\nWhen you have completed your check-in session and English evaluation, if needed, you can meet with an academic advisor to begin selecting courses. It is your responsibility to make sure you are enrolled full time (undergraduate: 12 credit hours, graduate: nine credit hours).\nKuwaiti-sponsored students are not permitted to enroll in online, evening, weekend, accelerated PACE or Arabic language courses without special permission from the Embassy of Kuwait. If an academic advisor discusses online courses during the course selection process, it is your responsibility to explain to the academic advisor that you are unable to enroll in online courses due to scholarship restrictions.\nLate enrollment fees are not covered by the Embassy of Kuwait.\nPlease review the Kuwait MOHE Rules and Regulations for more information.\nChange of major\nIf you wish to change your major you must first get approval from your advisor at the Embassy of Kuwait. If your advisor at the Embassy of Kuwait approves the change of major, you will receive a new financial guarantee which you must submit to us.\nStudent housing\nThere are a variety of living arrangements available to students. If you would like to learn more about on-campus housing, please review the information provided by Residential Life.\nON THIS PAGE\nWelcome to UMKC!\nFinancial guarantees\nCheck-in\nConsent form\nInternational Student Orientation\nEnglish evaluation\nHealth insurance\nEnrollment\nChange of major\nStudent housing\nApply\nVisit\nGet Info\nInternational Student Affairs Office\n+1 816-235-1113\nVolker Campus\n5000 Holmes St.\nKansas City, MO 64110-2499\nisao@umkc.edu\nAdmissions\nStudent Advising\nStudent Visa\nStudent Support\nInternational Affairs\nStudy Abroad and Global Exchange\nResidential Life\nKansas City\nLocation and Maps\nCampus Calendar\nA-Z Index\nJobs\nDirectory\nDiversity and Inclusion\nLibraries\nHelp Central\nConsumer Information\nAccreditation\nWebmail\nPathway\nCanvas\nUMKC Connect\nMyRoo\n© 2023 Curators of the University of Missouri | Disability Resources | Privacy Policy | DMCA Policy | Issues with this website? | Editor Access\nUMKC is an equal opportunity/access/affirmative action/pro-disability and veteran employer and does not discriminate on the basis of sex in our education programs or activities, pursuant to Title IX and 34 CFR Part 106.

Because you are sponsored by the Embassy of Kuwait, there are specific instructions to follow and requirements to meet.\nFinancial guarantees\nA financial guarantee from the Embassy of Kuwait is required for us to bill the embassy for your tuition and fees. Typically, your advisor at the Embassy of Kuwait will send your financial guarantee directly to our sponsored student officer. If you are receiving bills from the Cashiers Office saying you have unpaid tuition, request a copy of your financial guarantee and email it to our sponsored student officer, Morgan Ramsey.\nCheck-in\nWhen you arrive in Kansas City, you will need to schedule a check-in session through Online Services. Bring passports, student visa, I-20s, I-94s and a local address to your check-in session.\nConsent form\nA Consent Form (PDF) is required for sponsored students because UMKC needs permission from the student to issue student information to a sponsoring agency. You will be asked to complete a consent form at your check-in session.\nInternational Student Orientation\nThe mandatory International Student Orientation is usually held on the Tuesday before classes start. Failure to attend orientation will result in a hold on your account, which prevents you from enrolling in future semesters. The only way to remove this hold is to attend another orientation.\nEnglish evaluation\nStudents who are conditionally admitted to UMKC will be required to take an English evaluation at the Applied Language Institute upon arrival. This evaluation will determine what level of ESL courses might be required.\nHealth insurance\nAll new international students are automatically enrolled in UMKC’s student health insurance program. Because Kuwaiti-sponsored students and their dependents receive insurance through the Embassy of Kuwait, you do not need to have this student insurance. To avoid being automatically charged for UMKC health insurance, please complete a Health Insurance Waiver (PDF) and turn it in during your check-in session.\nEnrollment\nWhen you have completed your check-in session and English evaluation, if needed, you can meet with an academic advisor to begin selecting courses. It is your responsibility to make sure you are enrolled full time (undergraduate: 12 credit hours, graduate: nine credit hours).\nKuwaiti-sponsored students are not permitted to enroll in online, evening, weekend, accelerated PACE or Arabic language courses without special permission from the Embassy of Kuwait. If an academic advisor discusses online courses during the course selection process, it is your responsibility to explain to the academic advisor that you are unable to enroll in online courses due to scholarship restrictions.\nLate enrollment fees are not covered by the Embassy of Kuwait.\nPlease review the Kuwait MOHE Rules and Regulations for more information.\nChange of major\nIf you wish to change your major you must first get approval from your advisor at the Embassy of Kuwait. If your advisor at the Embassy of Kuwait approves the change of major, you will receive a new financial guarantee which you must submit to us.\nStudent housing\nThere are a variety of living arrangements available to students. If you would like to learn more about on-campus housing, please review the information provided by Residential Life.\nON THIS PAGE\nWelcome to UMKC!\nFinancial guarantees\nCheck-in\nConsent form\nInternational Student Orientation\nEnglish evaluation\nHealth insurance\nEnrollment\nChange of major\nStudent housing\nApply\nVisit\nGet Info\nInternational Student Affairs Office\n+1 816-235-1113\nVolker Campus\n5000 Holmes St.\nKansas City, MO 64110-2499\nisao@umkc.edu\nAdmissions\nStudent Advising\nStudent Visa\nStudent Support\nInternational Affairs\nStudy Abroad and Global Exchange\nResidential Life\nKansas City\nLocation and Maps\nCampus Calendar\nA-Z Index\nJobs\nDirectory\nDiversity and Inclusion\nLibraries\nHelp Central\nConsumer Information\nAccreditation\nWebmail\nPathway\nCanvas\nUMKC Connect\nMyRoo\n© 2023 Curators of the University of Missouri | Disability Resources | Privacy Policy | DMCA Policy | Issues with this website? | Editor Access\nUMKC is an equal opportunity/access/affirmative action/pro-disability and veteran employer and does not discriminate on the basis of sex in our education programs or activities, pursuant to Title IX and 34 CFR Part 106.

Because you are sponsored by the Embassy of Kuwait, there are specific instructions to follow and requirements to meet.\nFinancial guarantees\nA financial guarantee from the Embassy of Kuwait is required for us to bill the embassy for your tuition and fees. Typically, your advisor at the Embassy of Kuwait will send your financial guarantee directly to our sponsored student officer. If you are receiving bills from the Cashiers Office saying you have unpaid tuition, request a copy of your financial guarantee and email it to our sponsored student officer, Morgan Ramsey.\nCheck-in\nWhen you arrive in Kansas City, you will need to schedule a check-in session through Online Services. Bring passports, student visa, I-20s, I-94s and a local address to your check-in session.\nConsent form\nA Consent Form (PDF) is required for sponsored students because UMKC needs permission from the student to issue student information to a sponsoring agency. You will be asked to complete a consent form at your check-in session.\nInternational Student Orientation\nThe mandatory International Student Orientation is usually held on the Tuesday before classes start. Failure to attend orientation will result in a hold on your account, which prevents you from enrolling in future semesters. The only way to remove this hold is to attend another orientation.\nEnglish evaluation\nStudents who are conditionally admitted to UMKC will be required to take an English evaluation at the Applied Language Institute upon arrival. This evaluation will determine what level of ESL courses might be required.\nHealth insurance\nAll new international students are automatically enrolled in UMKC’s student health insurance program. Because Kuwaiti-sponsored students and their dependents receive insurance through the Embassy of Kuwait, you do not need to have this student insurance. To avoid being automatically charged for UMKC health insurance, please complete a Health Insurance Waiver (PDF) and turn it in during your check-in session.\nEnrollment\nWhen you have completed your check-in session and English evaluation, if needed, you can meet with an academic advisor to begin selecting courses. It is your responsibility to make sure you are enrolled full time (undergraduate: 12 credit hours, graduate: nine credit hours).\nKuwaiti-sponsored students are not permitted to enroll in online, evening, weekend, accelerated PACE or Arabic language courses without special permission from the Embassy of Kuwait. If an academic advisor discusses online courses during the course selection process, it is your responsibility to explain to the academic advisor that you are unable to enroll in online courses due to scholarship restrictions.\nLate enrollment fees are not covered by the Embassy of Kuwait.\nPlease review the Kuwait MOHE Rules and Regulations for more information.\nChange of major\nIf you wish to change your major you must first get approval from your advisor at the Embassy of Kuwait.

    "content": "UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-KANSAS CITY\nsearch\n\nInternational Student Affairs Office\nOman\nHome / Sponsored Students / Oman\nWe make it a priority to assist our Omani-sponsored students and to make the transition to life at UMKC in the United States as easy as possible.\nSPONSORED STUDENTS\nKuwait\nOman\nSaudi Arabia\nSponsor Information\nWelcome to UMKC!\nCongratulations on receiving a scholarship from the Embassy of Oman! We are pleased to welcome you to UMKC. Because you are sponsored by the Embassy of Oman, there are specific instructions to follow and requirements to meet.\nFinancial guarantee\nA financial guarantee from the Embassy of Oman is required for us to be able to bill the embassy for your tuition and fees. Typically, your embassy advisor will send your financial guarantee directly to our sponsored student officer. If you are receiving bills from the Cashiers Office saying you have unpaid tuition, please bring it to the attention of our sponsored student advisor, Morgan Ramsey.\nCheck-in\nWhen you arrive in Kansas City you will need to schedule a check-in session through Online Services. Bring passports, student visa, I-20s, I-94s and a local address to your check-in session.\nConsent form\nThe Consent Form (PDF) is required for sponsored students because UMKC needs permission from the student to issue student information to a sponsoring agency. In order for us to release your transcripts to the Embassy of Oman, we must have a copy of a consent form on file. You will be asked to complete a consent form at your check-in session.\nEnglish evaluation\nStudents who are conditionally admitted to UMKC will be required to take an English evaluation at the Applied Language Institute upon arrival. This evaluation will determine what level of ESL courses might be required.\nHealth insurance\nAll new international students are automatically enrolled into UMKC’s health insurance program. Omani- sponsored students receive insurance through the Embassy of Oman. To avoid automatic charges for UMKC health insurance, please complete a Health Insurance Waiver (PDF) and submit it during your check-in session.\nInternational Student Orientation\nThe mandatory International Student Orientation is always held on the Tuesday before classes start. Failure to attend orientation will result in a hold on your account, which prevents you from enrolling in future semesters. The only way to remove this hold is to attend another orientation.\nEnrollment\nWhen you have completed your check-in session and English evaluation (if needed), you can meet with an academic advisor to begin selecting courses. It is your responsibility to make sure you are enrolled full time (undergraduate: 12 credit hours, graduate: nine credit hours).\nOmani-sponsored students are not permitted to enroll in online, evening or Arabic language courses without special permission from the Embassy of Oman. If an academic advisor discusses online courses during the course selection process, it is your responsibility to explain to the academic advisor that you are unable to enroll in online courses due to scholarship restrictions.\nLate enrollment fees are not covered by the Embassy of Oman.\nChange of major\nIf you wish to change your major, you must first get approval from your advisor at the Embassy of Oman. If your advisor approves the change of major, you will receive a new financial guarantee which should be submitted to ISAO.\nStudent advisors at the Embassy of Oman\nUndergraduate: Amina Elaissami\nGraduate and doctoral students: Andreea Marusceac\nStudent housing\nThere are a variety of living arrangements available to students. If you would like to learn more about on campus housing, please review the information provided by Residential Life.\nON THIS PAGE\nWelcome to UMKC!\nFinancial guarantee\nCheck-in\nConsent form\nEnglish evaluation\nHealth insurance\nInternational Student Orientation\nEnrollment\nChange of major\nStudent housing\nApply\nVisit\nGet Info\nInternational Student Affairs Office\n+1 816-235-1113\nVolker Campus\n5000 Holmes St.\nKansas City, MO 64110-2499\nisao@umkc.edu\nAdmissions\nStudent Advising\nStudent Visa\nStudent Support\nInternational Affairs\nStudy Abroad and Global Exchange\nResidential Life\nKansas City\nLocation and Maps\nCampus Calendar\nA-Z Index\nJobs\nDirectory\nDiversity and Inclusion\nLibraries\nHelp Central\nConsumer Information\nAccreditation\nWebmail\nPathway\nCanvas\nUMKC Connect\nMyRoo\n© 2023 Curators of the University of Missouri | Disability Resources | Privacy Policy | DMCA Policy | Issues with this website? | Editor Access\nUMKC is an equal opportunity/access/affirmative action/pro-disability and veteran employer and does not discriminate on the basis of sex in our education programs or activities, pursuant to Title IX and 34 CFR Part 106.

We are pleased to welcome you to UMKC. Because you are sponsored by the Embassy of Oman, there are specific instructions to follow and requirements to meet.\nFinancial guarantee\nA financial guarantee from the Embassy of Oman is required for us to be able to bill the embassy for your tuition and fees. Typically, your embassy advisor will send your financial guarantee directly to our sponsored student officer. If you are receiving bills from the Cashiers Office saying you have unpaid tuition, please bring it to the attention of our sponsored student advisor, Morgan Ramsey.\nCheck-in\nWhen you arrive in Kansas City you will need to schedule a check-in session through Online Services. Bring passports, student visa, I-20s, I-94s and a local address to your check-in session.\nConsent form\nThe Consent Form (PDF) is required for sponsored students because UMKC needs permission from the student to issue student information to a sponsoring agency. In order for us to release your transcripts to the Embassy of Oman, we must have a copy of a consent form on file. You will be asked to complete a consent form at your check-in session.\nEnglish evaluation\nStudents who are conditionally admitted to UMKC will be required to take an English evaluation at the Applied Language Institute upon arrival.

To avoid automatic charges for UMKC health insurance, please complete a Health Insurance Waiver (PDF) and submit it during your check-in session.\nInternational Student Orientation\nThe mandatory International Student Orientation is always held on the Tuesday before classes start.

It is your responsibility to make sure you are enrolled full time (undergraduate: 12 credit hours, graduate: nine credit hours).\nOmani-sponsored students are not permitted to enroll in online, evening or Arabic language courses without special permission from the Embassy of Oman. If an academic advisor discusses online courses during the course selection process, it is your responsibility to explain to the academic advisor that you are unable to enroll in online courses due to scholarship restrictions.\nLate enrollment fees are not covered by the Embassy of Oman.\nChange of major\nIf you wish to change your major, you must first get approval from your advisor at the Embassy of Oman. If your advisor approves the change of major, you will receive a new financial guarantee which should be submitted to ISAO.\nStudent advisors at the Embassy of Oman\nUndergraduate: Amina Elaissami\nGraduate and doctoral students: Andreea Marusceac\nStudent housing\nThere are a variety of living arrangements available to students.

We are pleased to welcome you to UMKC. Because you are sponsored by the Embassy of Oman, there are specific instructions to follow and requirements to meet.\nFinancial guarantee\nA financial guarantee from the Embassy of Oman is required for us to be able to bill the embassy for your tuition and fees. Typically, your embassy advisor will send your financial guarantee directly to our sponsored student officer. If you are receiving bills from the Cashiers Office saying you have unpaid tuition, please bring it to the attention of our sponsored student advisor, Morgan Ramsey.\nCheck-in\nWhen you arrive in Kansas City you will need to schedule a check-in session through Online Services. Bring passports, student visa, I-20s, I-94s and a local address to your check-in session.\nConsent form\nThe Consent Form (PDF) is required for sponsored students because UMKC needs permission from the student to issue student information to a sponsoring agency. In order for us to release your transcripts to the Embassy of Oman, we must have a copy of a consent form on file. You will be asked to complete a consent form at your check-in session.\nEnglish evaluation\nStudents who are conditionally admitted to UMKC will be required to take an English evaluation at the Applied Language Institute upon arrival. This evaluation will determine what level of ESL courses might be required.\nHealth insurance\nAll new international students are automatically enrolled into UMKC’s health insurance program. Omani- sponsored students receive insurance through the Embassy of Oman. To avoid automatic charges for UMKC health insurance, please complete a Health Insurance Waiver (PDF) and submit it during your check-in session.\nInternational Student Orientation\nThe mandatory International Student Orientation is always held on the Tuesday before classes start. Failure to attend orientation will result in a hold on your account, which prevents you from enrolling in future semesters. The only way to remove this hold is to attend another orientation.\nEnrollment\nWhen you have completed your check-in session and English evaluation (if needed), you can meet with an academic advisor to begin selecting courses.

    "content": "UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-KANSAS CITY\nsearch\n\nInternational Student Affairs Office\nOman\nHome / Sponsored Students / Oman\nWe make it a priority to assist our Omani-sponsored students and to make the transition to life at UMKC in the United States as easy as possible.\nSPONSORED STUDENTS\nKuwait\nOman\nSaudi Arabia\nSponsor Information\nWelcome to UMKC!\nCongratulations on receiving a scholarship from the Embassy of Oman! We are pleased to welcome you to UMKC. Because you are sponsored by the Embassy of Oman, there are specific instructions to follow and requirements to meet.\nFinancial guarantee\nA financial guarantee from the Embassy of Oman is required for us to be able to bill the embassy for your tuition and fees. Typically, your embassy advisor will send your financial guarantee directly to our sponsored student officer. If you are receiving bills from the Cashiers Office saying you have unpaid tuition, please bring it to the attention of our sponsored student advisor, Morgan Ramsey.\nCheck-in\nWhen you arrive in Kansas City you will need to schedule a check-in session through Online Services. Bring passports, student visa, I-20s, I-94s and a local address to your check-in session.\nConsent form\nThe Consent Form (PDF) is required for sponsored students because UMKC needs permission from the student to issue student information to a sponsoring agency. In order for us to release your transcripts to the Embassy of Oman, we must have a copy of a consent form on file. You will be asked to complete a consent form at your check-in session.\nEnglish evaluation\nStudents who are conditionally admitted to UMKC will be required to take an English evaluation at the Applied Language Institute upon arrival. This evaluation will determine what level of ESL courses might be required.\nHealth insurance\nAll new international students are automatically enrolled into UMKC’s health insurance program. Omani- sponsored students receive insurance through the Embassy of Oman. To avoid automatic charges for UMKC health insurance, please complete a Health Insurance Waiver (PDF) and submit it during your check-in session.\nInternational Student Orientation\nThe mandatory International Student Orientation is always held on the Tuesday before classes start. Failure to attend orientation will result in a hold on your account, which prevents you from enrolling in future semesters. The only way to remove this hold is to attend another orientation.\nEnrollment\nWhen you have completed your check-in session and English evaluation (if needed), you can meet with an academic advisor to begin selecting courses. It is your responsibility to make sure you are enrolled full time (undergraduate: 12 credit hours, graduate: nine credit hours).\nOmani-sponsored students are not permitted to enroll in online, evening or Arabic language courses without special permission from the Embassy of Oman. If an academic advisor discusses online courses during the course selection process, it is your responsibility to explain to the academic advisor that you are unable to enroll in online courses due to scholarship restrictions.\nLate enrollment fees are not covered by the Embassy of Oman.\nChange of major\nIf you wish to change your major, you must first get approval from your advisor at the Embassy of Oman. If your advisor approves the change of major, you will receive a new financial guarantee which should be submitted to ISAO.\nStudent advisors at the Embassy of Oman\nUndergraduate: Amina Elaissami\nGraduate and doctoral students: Andreea Marusceac\nStudent housing\nThere are a variety of living arrangements available to students. If you would like to learn more about on campus housing, please review the information provided by Residential Life.\nON THIS PAGE\nWelcome to UMKC!\nFinancial guarantee\nCheck-in\nConsent form\nEnglish evaluation\nHealth insurance\nInternational Student Orientation\nEnrollment\nChange of major\nStudent housing\nApply\nVisit\nGet Info\nInternational Student Affairs Office\n+1 816-235-1113\nVolker Campus\n5000 Holmes St.\nKansas City, MO 64110-2499\nisao@umkc.edu\nAdmissions\nStudent Advising\nStudent Visa\nStudent Support\nInternational Affairs\nStudy Abroad and Global Exchange\nResidential Life\nKansas City\nLocation and Maps\nCampus Calendar\nA-Z Index\nJobs\nDirectory\nDiversity and Inclusion\nLibraries\nHelp Central\nConsumer Information\nAccreditation\nWebmail\nPathway\nCanvas\nUMKC Connect\nMyRoo\n© 2023 Curators of the University of Missouri | Disability Resources | Privacy Policy | DMCA Policy | Issues with this website? | Editor Access\nUMKC is an equal opportunity/access/affirmative action/pro-disability and veteran employer and does not discriminate on the basis of sex in our education programs or activities, pursuant to Title IX and 34 CFR Part 106.

These are provided to students by SACM only after meeting these conditions.\nThe student has submitted proof of eligibility for a SACM sponsorship (generally through a For Admissions Purposes Only letter)\nUMKC provides the student with a pre-admit letter to be given to SACM in return for the financial guarantee\nCheck-in session\nWhen you arrive in Kansas City, you will need to schedule a check-in session through Online Services. Bring passports, scholarship award letters, I-20s, I-94s and a local address to your check-in session.\nConsent Form\nThe Consent Form is a release of certain FERPA rights to UMKC, allowing the sharing of information between SACM and UMKC. Admitted students will be expected to complete a consent form at check-in.\nInternational Student Orientation\nThe mandatory International Student Orientation is always held on the Tuesday before classes start. Failure to attend orientation will result in a hold on your account, which prevents you from enrolling in future semesters. The only way to remove this hold is to attend another orientation.\nEnglish evaluation\nStudents placed at UMKC for academic coursework who have TOEFL scores of less than 100 iBT or IELTS scores of less than 6.5 will be required to take an English evaluation at the Applied Language Institute upon arrival.\nESL courses\nThose who are coming for short-term English studies will be taking ESL courses at our Applied Language Institute. Failure to complete the ESL coursework in the allotted time will prevent you from being released into academic coursework.\nSACM will pay for up to two academic years of English classes. Further enrollment in ALI must be paid by the student.\nEnrollment\nWhen students have completed the check-in session and their English evaluation, if needed, they can meet with an academic advisor to begin selecting and enrolling in courses. It is the student’s responsibility to make sure they are enrolled full time (undergraduate: 12 credit hours, graduate: nine credit hours).\nYou are not permitted to enroll in online, evening or Arabic language courses without special permission from SACM. If an academic advisor discusses online courses during the course selection process, it is your responsibility to explain to the academic advisor that you are unable to enroll in online courses due to scholarship restrictions.\nLate enrollment fees are not covered by SACM.\nChange of major\nSACM has approved students for scholarships based on the major for which they have applied. If you wish to change your major, you must first get approval from your SACM advisor. If your SACM advisor approves the change of major, you will receive a new financial guarantee which you should submit to ISAO.\nHealth insurance\nAll new international students are automatically enrolled in UMKC’s health insurance program. SACM-sponsored students and their dependents receive insurance through SACM. To avoid automatic charges for UMKC health insurance, complete a Health Insurance Waiver (PDF) and turn it in during your check-in session.\nStudent housing\nA student cannot submit a housing contract without an SSO or UMKC ID.\nON THIS PAGE\nWelcome to UMKC!\nFinancial guarantees\nCheck-in session\nConsent Form\nInternational Student Orientation\nEnglish evaluation\nESL courses\nEnrollment\nChange of major\nHealth insurance\nStudent housing\nApply\nVisit\nGet Info\nInternational Student Affairs Office\n+1 816-235-1113\nVolker Campus\n5000 Holmes St.\nKansas City, MO 64110-2499\nisao@umkc.edu\nAdmissions\nStudent Advising\nStudent Visa\nStudent Support\nInternational Affairs\nStudy Abroad and Global Exchange\nResidential Life\nKansas City\nLocation and Maps\nCampus Calendar\nA-Z Index\nJobs\nDirectory\nDiversity and Inclusion\nLibraries\nHelp Central\nConsumer Information\nAccreditation\nWebmail\nPathway\nCanvas\nUMKC Connect\nMyRoo\n© 2023 Curators of the University of Missouri | Disability Resources | Privacy Policy | DMCA Policy | Issues with this website? | Editor Access\nUMKC is an equal opportunity/access/affirmative action/pro-disability and veteran employer and does not discriminate on the basis of sex in our education programs or activities, pursuant to Title IX and 34 CFR Part 106.

These are provided to students by SACM only after meeting these conditions.\nThe student has submitted proof of eligibility for a SACM sponsorship (generally through a For Admissions Purposes Only letter)\nUMKC provides the student with a pre-admit letter to be given to SACM in return for the financial guarantee\nCheck-in session\nWhen you arrive in Kansas City, you will need to schedule a check-in session through Online Services. Bring passports, scholarship award letters, I-20s, I-94s and a local address to your check-in session.\nConsent Form\nThe Consent Form is a release of certain FERPA rights to UMKC, allowing the sharing of information between SACM and UMKC. Admitted students will be expected to complete a consent form at check-in.\nInternational Student Orientation\nThe mandatory International Student Orientation is always held on the Tuesday before classes start. Failure to attend orientation will result in a hold on your account, which prevents you from enrolling in future semesters. The only way to remove this hold is to attend another orientation.\nEnglish evaluation\nStudents placed at UMKC for academic coursework who have TOEFL scores of less than 100 iBT or IELTS scores of less than 6.5 will be required to take an English evaluation at the Applied Language Institute upon arrival.\nESL courses\nThose who are coming for short-term English studies will be taking ESL courses at our Applied Language Institute. Failure to complete the ESL coursework in the allotted time will prevent you from being released into academic coursework.\nSACM will pay for up to two academic years of English classes. Further enrollment in ALI must be paid by the student.\nEnrollment\nWhen students have completed the check-in session and their English evaluation, if needed, they can meet with an academic advisor to begin selecting and enrolling in courses. It is the student’s responsibility to make sure they are enrolled full time (undergraduate: 12 credit hours, graduate: nine credit hours).\nYou are not permitted to enroll in online, evening or Arabic language courses without special permission from SACM. If an academic advisor discusses online courses during the course selection process, it is your responsibility to explain to the academic advisor that you are unable to enroll in online courses due to scholarship restrictions.\nLate enrollment fees are not covered by SACM.\nChange of major\nSACM has approved students for scholarships based on the major for which they have applied. If you wish to change your major, you must first get approval from your SACM advisor. If your SACM advisor approves the change of major, you will receive a new financial guarantee which you should submit to ISAO.\nHealth insurance\nAll new international students are automatically enrolled in UMKC’s health insurance program. SACM-sponsored students and their dependents receive insurance through SACM. To avoid automatic charges for UMKC health insurance, complete a Health Insurance Waiver (PDF) and turn it in during your check-in session.\nStudent housing\nA student cannot submit a housing contract without an SSO or UMKC ID.\nON THIS PAGE\nWelcome to UMKC!\nFinancial guarantees\nCheck-in session\nConsent Form\nInternational Student Orientation\nEnglish evaluation\nESL courses\nEnrollment\nChange of major\nHealth insurance\nStudent housing\nApply\nVisit\nGet Info\nInternational Student Affairs Office\n+1 816-235-1113\nVolker Campus\n5000 Holmes St.\nKansas City, MO 64110-2499\nisao@umkc.edu\nAdmissions\nStudent Advising\nStudent Visa\nStudent Support\nInternational Affairs\nStudy Abroad and Global Exchange\nResidential Life\nKansas City\nLocation and Maps\nCampus Calendar\nA-Z Index\nJobs\nDirectory\nDiversity and Inclusion\nLibraries\nHelp Central\nConsumer Information\nAccreditation\nWebmail\nPathway\nCanvas\nUMKC Connect\nMyRoo\n© 2023 Curators of the University of Missouri | Disability Resources | Privacy Policy | DMCA Policy | Issues with this website? | Editor Access\nUMKC is an equal opportunity/access/affirmative action/pro-disability and veteran employer and does not discriminate on the basis of sex in our education programs or activities, pursuant to Title IX and 34 CFR Part 106.

    "content": "UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-KANSAS CITY\nsearch\n\nInternational Student Affairs Office\nSaudi Arabia\nHome / Sponsored Students / Saudi Arabia\nWe make it a priority to assist our Saudi Arabian Cultural Mission (SACM)-sponsored students and to make the transition to life at UMKC and in the United States as easy as possible.\nSPONSORED STUDENTS\nKuwait\nOman\nSaudi Arabia\nSponsor Information\nWelcome to UMKC!\nWe are excited that you have chosen to attend UMKC and look forward to meeting you on campus. \nWe understand the importance of a scholarship from SACM, and we're here to answer your questions about sponsorship and enrollment.\nFinancial guarantees\nA financial guarantee from SACM is required in order to receive full admission and an I-20 form from UMKC. These are provided to students by SACM only after meeting these conditions.\nThe student has submitted proof of eligibility for a SACM sponsorship (generally through a For Admissions Purposes Only letter)\nUMKC provides the student with a pre-admit letter to be given to SACM in return for the financial guarantee\nCheck-in session\nWhen you arrive in Kansas City, you will need to schedule a check-in session through Online Services. Bring passports, scholarship award letters, I-20s, I-94s and a local address to your check-in session.\nConsent Form\nThe Consent Form is a release of certain FERPA rights to UMKC, allowing the sharing of information between SACM and UMKC. Admitted students will be expected to complete a consent form at check-in.\nInternational Student Orientation\nThe mandatory International Student Orientation is always held on the Tuesday before classes start. Failure to attend orientation will result in a hold on your account, which prevents you from enrolling in future semesters. The only way to remove this hold is to attend another orientation.\nEnglish evaluation\nStudents placed at UMKC for academic coursework who have TOEFL scores of less than 100 iBT or IELTS scores of less than 6.5 will be required to take an English evaluation at the Applied Language Institute upon arrival.\nESL courses\nThose who are coming for short-term English studies will be taking ESL courses at our Applied Language Institute. Failure to complete the ESL coursework in the allotted time will prevent you from being released into academic coursework.\nSACM will pay for up to two academic years of English classes. Further enrollment in ALI must be paid by the student.\nEnrollment\nWhen students have completed the check-in session and their English evaluation, if needed, they can meet with an academic advisor to begin selecting and enrolling in courses. It is the student’s responsibility to make sure they are enrolled full time (undergraduate: 12 credit hours, graduate: nine credit hours).\nYou are not permitted to enroll in online, evening or Arabic language courses without special permission from SACM. If an academic advisor discusses online courses during the course selection process, it is your responsibility to explain to the academic advisor that you are unable to enroll in online courses due to scholarship restrictions.\nLate enrollment fees are not covered by SACM.\nChange of major\nSACM has approved students for scholarships based on the major for which they have applied. If you wish to change your major, you must first get approval from your SACM advisor. If your SACM advisor approves the change of major, you will receive a new financial guarantee which you should submit to ISAO.\nHealth insurance\nAll new international students are automatically enrolled in UMKC’s health insurance program.

    "content": "UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-KANSAS CITY\nsearch\n\nInternational Student Affairs Office\nSaudi Arabia\nHome / Sponsored Students / Saudi Arabia\nWe make it a priority to assist our Saudi Arabian Cultural Mission (SACM)-sponsored students and to make the transition to life at UMKC and in the United States as easy as possible.\nSPONSORED STUDENTS\nKuwait\nOman\nSaudi Arabia\nSponsor Information\nWelcome to UMKC!\nWe are excited that you have chosen to attend UMKC and look forward to meeting you on campus. \nWe understand the importance of a scholarship from SACM, and we're here to answer your questions about sponsorship and enrollment.\nFinancial guarantees\nA financial guarantee from SACM is required in order to receive full admission and an I-20 form from UMKC. These are provided to students by SACM only after meeting these conditions.\nThe student has submitted proof of eligibility for a SACM sponsorship (generally through a For Admissions Purposes Only letter)\nUMKC provides the student with a pre-admit letter to be given to SACM in return for the financial guarantee\nCheck-in session\nWhen you arrive in Kansas City, you will need to schedule a check-in session through Online Services. Bring passports, scholarship award letters, I-20s, I-94s and a local address to your check-in session.\nConsent Form\nThe Consent Form is a release of certain FERPA rights to UMKC, allowing the sharing of information between SACM and UMKC. Admitted students will be expected to complete a consent form at check-in.\nInternational Student Orientation\nThe mandatory International Student Orientation is always held on the Tuesday before classes start. Failure to attend orientation will result in a hold on your account, which prevents you from enrolling in future semesters. The only way to remove this hold is to attend another orientation.\nEnglish evaluation\nStudents placed at UMKC for academic coursework who have TOEFL scores of less than 100 iBT or IELTS scores of less than 6.5 will be required to take an English evaluation at the Applied Language Institute upon arrival.\nESL courses\nThose who are coming for short-term English studies will be taking ESL courses at our Applied Language Institute. Failure to complete the ESL coursework in the allotted time will prevent you from being released into academic coursework.\nSACM will pay for up to two academic years of English classes. Further enrollment in ALI must be paid by the student.\nEnrollment\nWhen students have completed the check-in session and their English evaluation, if needed, they can meet with an academic advisor to begin selecting and enrolling in courses. It is the student’s responsibility to make sure they are enrolled full time (undergraduate: 12 credit hours, graduate: nine credit hours).\nYou are not permitted to enroll in online, evening or Arabic language courses without special permission from SACM. If an academic advisor discusses online courses during the course selection process, it is your responsibility to explain to the academic advisor that you are unable to enroll in online courses due to scholarship restrictions.\nLate enrollment fees are not covered by SACM.\nChange of major\nSACM has approved students for scholarships based on the major for which they have applied. If you wish to change your major, you must first get approval from your SACM advisor. If your SACM advisor approves the change of major, you will receive a new financial guarantee which you should submit to ISAO.\nHealth insurance\nAll new international students are automatically enrolled in UMKC’s health insurance program. SACM-sponsored students and their dependents receive insurance through SACM. To avoid automatic charges for UMKC health insurance, complete a Health Insurance Waiver (PDF) and turn it in during your check-in session.\nStudent housing\nA student cannot submit a housing contract without an SSO or UMKC ID.\nON THIS PAGE\nWelcome to UMKC!\nFinancial guarantees\nCheck-in session\nConsent Form\nInternational Student Orientation\nEnglish evaluation\nESL courses\nEnrollment\nChange of major\nHealth insurance\nStudent housing\nApply\nVisit\nGet Info\nInternational Student Affairs Office\n+1 816-235-1113\nVolker Campus\n5000 Holmes St.\nKansas City, MO 64110-2499\nisao@umkc.edu\nAdmissions\nStudent Advising\nStudent Visa\nStudent Support\nInternational Affairs\nStudy Abroad and Global Exchange\nResidential Life\nKansas City\nLocation and Maps\nCampus Calendar\nA-Z Index\nJobs\nDirectory\nDiversity and Inclusion\nLibraries\nHelp Central\nConsumer Information\nAccreditation\nWebmail\nPathway\nCanvas\nUMKC Connect\nMyRoo\n© 2023 Curators of the University of Missouri | Disability Resources | Privacy Policy | DMCA Policy | Issues with this website? | Editor Access\nUMKC is an equal opportunity/access/affirmative action/pro-disability and veteran employer and does not discriminate on the basis of sex in our education programs or activities, pursuant to Title IX and 34 CFR Part 106.

These are provided to students by SACM only after meeting these conditions.\nThe student has submitted proof of eligibility for a SACM sponsorship (generally through a For Admissions Purposes Only letter)\nUMKC provides the student with a pre-admit letter to be given to SACM in return for the financial guarantee\nCheck-in session\nWhen you arrive in Kansas City, you will need to schedule a check-in session through Online Services. Bring passports, scholarship award letters, I-20s, I-94s and a local address to your check-in session.\nConsent Form\nThe Consent Form is a release of certain FERPA rights to UMKC, allowing the sharing of information between SACM and UMKC. Admitted students will be expected to complete a consent form at check-in.\nInternational Student Orientation\nThe mandatory International Student Orientation is always held on the Tuesday before classes start. Failure to attend orientation will result in a hold on your account, which prevents you from enrolling in future semesters. The only way to remove this hold is to attend another orientation.\nEnglish evaluation\nStudents placed at UMKC for academic coursework who have TOEFL scores of less than 100 iBT or IELTS scores of less than 6.5 will be required to take an English evaluation at the Applied Language Institute upon arrival.\nESL courses\nThose who are coming for short-term English studies will be taking ESL courses at our Applied Language Institute. Failure to complete the ESL coursework in the allotted time will prevent you from being released into academic coursework.\nSACM will pay for up to two academic years of English classes. Further enrollment in ALI must be paid by the student.\nEnrollment\nWhen students have completed the check-in session and their English evaluation, if needed, they can meet with an academic advisor to begin selecting and enrolling in courses. It is the student’s responsibility to make sure they are enrolled full time (undergraduate: 12 credit hours, graduate: nine credit hours).\nYou are not permitted to enroll in online, evening or Arabic language courses without special permission from SACM. If an academic advisor discusses online courses during the course selection process, it is your responsibility to explain to the academic advisor that you are unable to enroll in online courses due to scholarship restrictions.\nLate enrollment fees are not covered by SACM.\nChange of major\nSACM has approved students for scholarships based on the major for which they have applied. If you wish to change your major, you must first get approval from your SACM advisor. If your SACM advisor approves the change of major, you will receive a new financial guarantee which you should submit to ISAO.\nHealth insurance\nAll new international students are automatically enrolled in UMKC’s health insurance program. SACM-sponsored students and their dependents receive insurance through SACM. To avoid automatic charges for UMKC health insurance, complete a Health Insurance Waiver (PDF) and turn it in during your check-in session.\nStudent housing\nA student cannot submit a housing contract without an SSO or UMKC ID.\nON THIS PAGE\nWelcome to UMKC!\nFinancial guarantees\nCheck-in session\nConsent Form\nInternational Student Orientation\nEnglish evaluation\nESL courses\nEnrollment\nChange of major\nHealth insurance\nStudent housing\nApply\nVisit\nGet Info\nInternational Student Affairs Office\n+1 816-235-1113\nVolker Campus\n5000 Holmes St.\nKansas City, MO 64110-2499\nisao@umkc.edu\nAdmissions\nStudent Advising\nStudent Visa\nStudent Support\nInternational Affairs\nStudy Abroad and Global Exchange\nResidential Life\nKansas City\nLocation and Maps\nCampus Calendar\nA-Z Index\nJobs\nDirectory\nDiversity and Inclusion\nLibraries\nHelp Central\nConsumer Information\nAccreditation\nWebmail\nPathway\nCanvas\nUMKC Connect\nMyRoo\n© 2023 Curators of the University of Missouri | Disability Resources | Privacy Policy | DMCA Policy | Issues with this website? | Editor Access\nUMKC is an equal opportunity/access/affirmative action/pro-disability and veteran employer and does not discriminate on the basis of sex in our education programs or activities, pursuant to Title IX and 34 CFR Part 106.
